Woo-hoo! I finally upgrade my PC hard drive from Transcend 120 GB SSD to Western Digital Black 1 TB NVMe drive.

Just before covid hit I was collecting components for building a custom PC. One of the components I couldn't upgrade was the NVMe drive as it was too expensive, and supply chain had been hit due to lockdown in most countries

My PC Configuration

- Processor AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor, 3801 MHz, 12 Core(s), 24 Logical Processor(s)
- Asus ROG STRIX X570-E GAMING Motherboard
- RAM: 64 GB
- Graphic Card: MSI GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER™ GAMING X TRIO

I had recently upgraded to window 11 and that took a toll on the space of my 120 GB SSD which now had only 7 GB left. That's when I started scouting for good NVMe drives and there are so many. I finally zeroed in on the Western Digital WD SN850 1 TB, PCIe Gen 4. I had already taken care of getting a good motherboard which supported Gen4 NVMe drives with in built heat sink for my future needs.

The reviews of this WD SN850 drive was pretty good with an average rating of 4/5. Anyway I got the drive and was all set to install. The first challenge I faced was figuring out a good way to remove the NVMe cover. In the Asus Motherboard is way below my graphic card. I had to first remove the graphic card and then open up couple of screws for the fan before I could access the NVMe drive slots.

I thought things will be easy from now only to realize that this NVMe drive doesn't come with an m.2 screw and sleeve. Both of these are needed to support the NVMe drive. Quickly searched my motherboard box but found all other screws except the m.2 screws. How I wish the drive manufacturers could bundle these with their drives. It's so frustrating to order it separately.

Note: these screws are different for PC and laptop. I order one for PC which has screws for MSI, ASUS and Gigabyte motherboards. Getting the correct screws and sleeve is so important. In Asus motherboard the sleeve to be used is a small one. There is so much confusion so my advice is to order according to your system spec else you will be frustrated when these don't fit your motherboard.

These screws are a tad bit expensive and took me a good 2 weeks to get it delivered by Amazon. Anyway got the screws, and they fit perfectly, and I was all set. BTW the in built heat sink has a sticker which needs to be removed so that the sticky insulation piece can get glued on to the SN850 to provide heat insulation.

(All Assembled !!!)

Now my next hurdle was how to transfer the licensed Windows 11 OS from the SSD to the new NVMe and that's when I got to know about MiniTool Partition Wizard

Note: Download version 10 or below as it's a free version. Anything above or the latest is now a paid version

The migration using this tool was simple, easy and a breeze.
Below are some pics of the installation process

As seen from the above pics the installation is fairly simple, and I didn't lose any data. You need to take care of unassigning drive letters to system drives.

I now have a new M.2 drive which is blazing fast, and I am super happy with its performance.
