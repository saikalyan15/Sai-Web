My friend has his website built in Wix a year back. When it came for renewal he approached me for advise on how to revamp his website. After a little research on Google trends it was very evident that WordPress has had a huge adoption rate

Both Wix have good interfaces to build website without having any programming knowledge, but I found the plugin ecosystem to be vast and comprehensive on WordPress. I also realized that the one who had developed the website chose Wix as it was simple and had a very intuitive interface for one who didn't have any web development experience. I have also seen coders finding WordPress more flexible. Furthermore, I think that's what attracted me towards WordPress.
Even though WordPress is free you still need to be for hosting costs. I zeroed in on Bluehost.in and got a very good discount upon selecting a 3-year renewal plan costing under 75 USD. I must admit there was quite a bit of learning curve but once you get the hang of it, It's pretty easy. Thanks to countless tutorials on YouTube, setting up a default WordPress website shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Things get interesting when you need to customize the website.

WordPress along with Elementor lets you create stunning websites in minutes. WordPress is far superior to Wix and I believe in the long run one can accomplish a lot with WordPress. Following a minimalistic design we build a whole new website and made it operational very quickly.
