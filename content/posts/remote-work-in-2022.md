_“People are more productive working at home than people would have expected. Some people thought that everything was just going to fall apart, and it hasn't”_ - Mark Zuckerberg

A survey done by Flex jobs has revealed that 51% of respondents believe they were more productive from home during COVID-19 and 95% believe their productivity has gone up while working remotely. Developers were able to work with fewer interruptions. Some of them were able to travel to quiet destinations and focus on work better without many distractions. They set up their home office in a way that they could relax and work without getting too stressed.

What factors have improved productivity
Developers worked more hours when working remotely than they did working in office. Factors like commute, tea breaks, office gossip and distractions came down to a minimum with remote work.
Flexibility to work from anywhere and flexible schedule helped people engage with distributed teams much more effectively
They were able to have more focussed time
Women especially were able to manage their time better juggling personal and professional tasks
Trends have also indicated that productivity improved as the age increased. Older folks were able to have better productivity compared to their younger associates.
Teams started planning tasks better and communication between associates became very focussed and to the point and of shorter duration
Employees looked well rested and few of them got back to some form of fitness routine or sports
Self Learning took a spike when employees were working remotely

Side Effects of Remote Work

1. Poor internet connectivity
2. Ad-Hoc Disturbance
3. Employee felt left out due to lack of interaction
4. Employees tend to burn out
5. Employee engagement takes a drastic dip as everyone is now working in silos
6. Difficulty in participating in conversations remotely
7. Challenges around Hiring and onboarding of new employees
8. Issues around moonlighting and personal distractions / errands have caused employees to miss important meetings and discussions
9. Difficulty in setting boundaries between hoe and work
10. Troubleshooting devices on the field need physical presence

Pandemic forced many organizations to invest in their IT infrastructure so that their employees could work remotely. It has also changed the mindset of traditional organizations that it is possible to work remotely for their line of business.

Developers have collaborated better with their peers on programming challenges, troubleshooting and diagnosing defects with remote screen share.

On the flip side there have been instances of developers claiming to be working on a project only to find out later that they were engaged in their personal tasks.

One of the major drawbacks of remote work is active participation during meetings. Oftentimes we have seen employees switch off their cameras and mic leaving one guessing whether the individual is present or have they left for some other task.

While on other occasions cutting down on background conversations from family members or television have been difficult to control and moderate thereby resulting in less productive meetings. This especially true for large participant meetings.

**Conclusion**

Remote work is here to stay. There is no denying the fact that employees are looking for some flexibility in their work schedules. At the same time true engagement happens in person and a lot of them look forward to meeting their colleagues occasionally away from the home grind. There could be a debate on the percentage of remote work but we can conclude that the organization will continue to give it as an option for employees in 2023. Hybrid model is the way forward
