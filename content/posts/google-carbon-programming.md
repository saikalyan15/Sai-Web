Do we really need a new programming language or a successor to C++? When I heard about Google's Carbon, there were so many posts talking about how to get started with Carbon and how it's so much better than C++

But for me, the fundamental question is what is the use case for Carbon? It was good of Google to put forth the intent of the why. A few points that I could capture were

- C++ still remains the most dominant programming language for performance-critical software with a huge learning curve
- It is extremely difficult to improve C++
- C++ projects are quite complex
- A large amount of technical debt to meet C++ developer needs

Below are the possible scenarios for why to use Carbon

1. Migrating existing C++ code bases to Carbon
2. Interop existing C++ code and build new features in carbon
3. New development from scratch using Carbon

Over the years we have seen languages like ODIN and RUST take some share of C++ development.

From a practical standpoint it has always been difficult to hire C++ developers. Good C++ developers are small, and the learning curve is pretty high. Often that has been one of the drivers to migrate C++ projects to other languages. However, for certain types of applications, especially those closer to hardware C++ is still one of the preferred options because of its ease in manipulating resources, CPU-intensive functions, and blazing speed. E.g. games, operating systems, device drivers, embedded, etc.

I don't see application development using Carbon as there are plenty of languages that are simple and serve the purpose, however, existing C++ code bases, device drives, gaming, etc. would benefit to have a turbocharged C++ for developers with Carbon programming language.

 I remember when Microsoft brought in .NET they introduced the C# language, but they also wanted to appease the vast VB developers to get on to .NET and hence they included VB.NET along with C#. They also wanted to protect the vast number of VB projects and bring in potential migration opportunities. But over a while, even the existing VB developers felt very comfortable with C#. I see a similar synergy with C++ and Carbon

 Only time will tell if Carbon is a hit or miss. Thank you for taking time to read my view point.
