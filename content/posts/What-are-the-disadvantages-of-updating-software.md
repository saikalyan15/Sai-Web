There have been times I have regretted upgrading a software. The other day I was trying to use a partition software only to find it has become paid. I had to search for an older version which was free in order to get the job done. Below I will list down few reasons why updating software is a bad idea.

1. The new update has broken old functionality
2. The new update removes the free version and make it a paid version
3. The update has broken integration with supported apps
4. The new update has made it slow to work with as now the new version needs a better spec hardware
5. The new version has introduced more bugs
6. Software size has increased and now takes a long time to install and function.
7. Users are so used to functionality offered by old version that they don't feel the need to upgrade to a new version
8. The new software now breaks functionality of other apps, and they don't load or exit prematurely due to errors
9. The new user experience is counterintuitive
10. The update only works on the new version of the operating system
11. The new update takes more space
12. Data loss 
13. Corruption of system files

Despite all the disadvantages, one must always look to upgrade to the latest software as they would contain new features, bug fixes and security updates. What's key is Incas if there are issues who quickly, and easily you can roll back to the earlier release without loosing data. Often it's always good to read reviews from users who have upgraded to the new release and learn how their experience has been.
