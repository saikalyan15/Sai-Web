This week I attended the Bengaluru Tech Summit which was held at Bangalore Palace. It was interesting to here from different speakers from the government and the industry on where India needs to head in the world of computing.

It was very insightful hearing the talk from Ajay Kumar Sood, Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India. It was fascinating to know about the Government digital platform [Manthan](https://manthan.gov.in/), which aims to promote collaboration between the industry and the scientific and research development ecosystem through an information of exchange.

There was also the formal launch of Bengaluru Science & Technology Cluster (BEST) which aims to provide solutions for industries and government which include academic institutions, industry partners, startups, civil society organizations and government bodies. There are similar such clusters in Delhi, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Jodhpur and Pune.

I was able to attend few of the sessions and panel discussions on startups, deep tech and digital sovereignty. There were few sessions on investment in countries like France, Germany and Finland. There was a lot of talk on 6G, deep tech which was quite insightful.

I also did get a chance to visit the numerous stalls from products to services, metaverse and blockchain. It was good to attend an event like this after a long time. I guess it was my first since covid.
