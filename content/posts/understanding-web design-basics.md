A while back I started learning a very popular course on Udemy called "The Complete Web Development Boot camp" by Angela Yu. It's an amazing course and will do a review of it once I complete it.

In so many years of web development we often focus on learning the language, syntax, code be it asp, asp.net, angular, react but seldom does a developer take into account the web design aspects of it. At least I thought that the job of the graphic designer and not me.

Reading about four elements of web design was quite an eye-opener.

There are four aspects to web design. We will look at it one by one.

**Color Theory :** It's so important to choose the right colors. Each color reflects a particular mood like Red depicts excitement, strength, love energy while a green color would relate to nature, healing, freshness, quality. Have you noticed that most of the groceries online will have green as one of their colors? You can know more about colors here [Color Psychology from London Image Institute](https://londonimageinstitute.com/how-to-empower-yourself-with-color-psychology/)
I did have a faint idea on colors, but I never perceived it in this manner.

Similarly, there is also a method of combining colors. For example if you would like to use more than one color for say navigation or background of your website choosing colors next to each other would have a high impact. These are called Analogous Colors [Wikipedia: Analogous Colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogous_colors)

But you want something to stand out you would use colors from the opposite side of the color wheel. These are called Complementary Colors like a purple-yellow combination or red-green combination. [Wikipedia: Analogous Colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors)

There are some interesting websites which give you the right color combination palette like [Colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co) which you can use for your web projects.

**Typography :** Selecting the right type of font is so important considering the mood you want to set in. There are broadly two types of category of font families viz. Serif and San-Serifs

Serif family fonts indicate serious, elegant, respectable and authoritative kind of mood. San-Serif family fonts is more modern and contemporary.

For a website don't have more than two fonts else it will look very cluttered and repulsive.

**User Interface Design :** User Interface design is all about anticipating what the users need and to show it in a way that's easy to understand, access and facilitate action. For e.g. highlighting buttons with a different color is a great way to entice user to move towards that button than other buttons in the page. You will see these in checkout pages, sign in etc. Sometimes they are also sized differently. In some cases the font is made bold. These are few examples of how to shift the user attention to where you want them to go.

**User Experience Design (UX) :** User experience is all about making the experience awesome for the user when they visit your website. How do we achieve that?  
There is a 5-step process to it

- Simplicity
- Consistency
- Reading Patterns (F Layout pattern, Z-Layout pattern etc. Facebook uses a Z-pattern layout)
- All platform design (PC/Mobile/Tablet : responsive design)
- Don't use your powers for evil (E.g. trying to force users to opt for paid subscription. Trying to force users to perform actions that are beneficial to the company and not the user)

I really loved learning this aspect of web design and also gave it a short designing a website using CANVA.
