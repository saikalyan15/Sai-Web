Why did I ask my friend to move his domain name from GoDaddy? Read on ...

Last year my friend got his domain name from GoDaddy through an acquaintance. This time around he asked me to take a look and renew it for this year. I have never dealt with domain registrations before, so I thought this is a good opportunity to dig around.

GoDaddy is quite popular thanks to their extensive marketing. I quickly logged into his account and saw the domain details. He had taken a basic one which had no domain protection.

If you go for first time registration you will see this nice sweet price of Rs. 399 INR / 1st year.

If you go the next screen you will get these options like Full Domain protection and Ultimate Domain protection for a fee of course.

The costs would keep adding up and like any cost conscious person my friend went with No domain protection without realizing the consequence. So what does that mean?

- Your domain privacy is not protected. Every domain has a WHOIS listing which is searchable over the internet. If you don't protect your domain all your personal info get shared.
- So you need to pay extra so that GoDaddy doesn't share your information on the internet.
- By default, when you add to cart they will add a 2-year plan of renewal
- and if you add the Full domain protection that's an additional Rs. 299 INR

My first impression about the whole experience? I feel they are trying to swindle me off my money. First the intentional 2 yr renewal. If I change to 1 yr below is what it will cost you. My friend chooses no protection, and he didn't even get an SSL certificate.
I told him folks will shy away from your website if they don't see an SSL certificate

Most of us will rush to pay and not see that what costed you Rs. 399 for 1st year will become Rs 1199 from 2nd year. 

I started researching for other name registrars in the business. There are so many like domain.com, Bluehost, host gator, Namecheap and so on. The best rates are provided by Cloudflare as they give you domain names at wholesale price. 

As part of my research I zeroed in on porkbun.com. What I loved about the interface was it wasn't trying to sell me stuff or swindle me.

It clearly showed me what's the charges for the year, no upsell of privacy and so forth and guess what, the domain protection, SSL certificate all for the price of $9.73 which is about Rs.775 INR.

It was a no-brainer for me. I felt GoDaddy was just swindling me of my money. I called up my friend and told him I got a better deal and I will go ahead and renew with Porkbun and do a domain transfer. He was all worry and was suggesting we should just renew with GoDaddy. I was like no way. Long story short I got his domain transferred, renewed all for the price of Rs. 775 INR within a day, and you know what I also get an email from GoDaddy for a discounted rate of Rs. 806.90 instead of Rs 1213.04 INR which is still higher than what I got from Porkbun.

Their support is so-so and once contacted them you will get a response in 4-5 hours, there is no immediate support/ chat option so do keep that in mind. However, you will get a response. Overall I was happy with the response I got from support.

I am sure there are plenty other domain registrars that are good, and I haven't had time to look through all of them, but I definitely would not recommend GoDaddy. Please do your due diligence before purchasing your domain.

P. S : I have heard some good reviews about Bluehost and hostgator too. Do check them out.
