Over the years I have realized how important it is to have one on ones on a regular basis. Often employees and managers feel that it doesn't make sense to have 1:1 every week and better to have it once in a quarter or so. I have seen cases where managers do it once in six months. I feel one on ones are needed once in a week and the meeting invites needs to be blocked for the entire year upfront as this cadence brings in predictability and seriousness into your relationship with your direct reportees. It also help you connect with them at a deeper level and has a tremendous impact on their performance.

There are many questions that can arise on how a 1:1 should be like. Often its good to have a rolling agenda where both you and your reportee is able to view and add the agenda item during the course of the week as the situation arises and things unfold. Its good to come prepared with a few sets of questions as often at times the employees are not willing to open up or is highly introverted.

The agenda could start with observations from the past week to deep dive on a topic / architecture. The Manager needs to remember that these meetings are more for them to speak and you to listen. As a guideline your direct reports need to do 70% of the talking while your job is all about absorbing and guiding.

Remember that silence is golden. In the past I used to get very restless if there are long pauses or silence. I soon realised how long silence can help the reportees bring out problems to the surface. Do not make 1:1's to be a status update meeting

Its also important to keep detailed notes that has potential to lead to action. But one should also keep in mind to keep the conversation strictly professional. Do not try to be a therapist.
