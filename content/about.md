I'm Sai, a technical program manager and freelance writer from Bangalore, India

I have been programming since 1998 and worked in desktop, web, ckoud and iot based applications.
In my current role I manage several scrum teams. I am an agile mentor for all my teams and have a passion for programming.
So much so that I have used it to build a series of automations on project delivery and quality metrics on top of Jira and reporting it in Confluence.

From an education perspective I have done my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering but soon realised after completion that software if the field for me.
