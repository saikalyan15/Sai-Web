I'm Sai, a technical program manager and freelance writer from Bangalore, India

I am a technical program manager working on IOT based applications, programming in Jira and Confluence to track live metrics across distributed teams across geographies. I am also an agile coach mentoring and coaching my teams on agile practices.
I strongly believe in continuous learning and improving myself and hence I am always on the lookout for opportunities to apply technology to real-life problems. I am currently learning python and exploring Azure ADX. I intend to start writing on technical aspects that I have encountered and how I solved them. Hope to put out something soon.

From an education perspective I have done my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering but soon realized after completion that software is the field for me.
