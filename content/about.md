I'm Sai, a technical program manager and freelance writer from Bangalore, India

I have been programming since 1998 and worked in desktop, web, cloud and iot based applications.
In my current role I manage several scrum teams. I am an agile mentor for all my teams and have a passion for programming.
I have used my programming skills to write custom queries in confluence which pulls data from Jira to give me real-time updates of all my teams.

From an education perspective I have done my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering but soon realized after completion that software is the field for me.
