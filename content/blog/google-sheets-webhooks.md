# Reducing Manual Data Entry with Google Sheets + Webhooks

A friend managing inventory in Google Sheets asked me if I could help sync that data to a backend tool. He was spending hours manually updating the same info in two places.

Instead of building a complex integration from scratch, I turned to **n8n**.

## The Problem

- Data was being added to Google Sheets manually
- The same data needed to be pushed to a backend tool (Airtable, or custom API)
- Errors were creeping in due to human copy-paste

## My Approach

Here's how I solved it with no additional cost:

1. **Trigger**: Google Sheets webhook using AppScript  
2. **n8n Workflow**:
   - Receives data via webhook
   - Validates the payload
   - Sends it to the target API (in this case, Airtable)
3. **Logs Success/Error in Google Sheets**

## Why It Works

This system is lightweight, robust, and easily scalable. Most importantly, it eliminated 3+ hours of redundant work per week.

## Key Learnings

- Webhooks are underrated — they enable powerful low-latency automation
- n8n is great at API chaining, error handling, and scheduling
- Even non-tech users can benefit from one-time setup + good docs

## Try This Yourself

If you've got a spreadsheet workflow that feels repetitive, odds are you can automate it with just a few nodes.
