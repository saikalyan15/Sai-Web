- A Portfolio of Small Bets by Daniel Vassalo (https://dvassallo.gumroad.com/l/small-bets)
  I loved this cohort and has been one of my inspiration to take a sabbatical. I love the message he sends on how to take multiple smallbets and keep pivoting. Focus on doing multiple small projects rather than one large project. Dont look at perfection but release work within short time frame and get feedback aka fail-fast. Its a six session cohort that spans two weeks and you get exposed to wonderful members of the smallbets community.
